title: MPLabX Microcontroller Code

## Overview

This zip file contains all the files generated by MPLabX when packaging the project, including Demo_This_Better_Work_GC.zip, which contains the main.c file that runs the code on the microcontroller. This code processes the signal sent by the light sensor, amplified by the op-amp, and converts the reading to values ​​that the microcontroller can read, turning on the corresponding LED. The controller also receives information from the proximity subsystem, overwriting the light sensor code. The microcontroller also sends information to the speaker subsystem if the established light limits are reached.

The Code files for the Microcontroller are available <a href="https://github.com/Ludael02/gael_chavez.github.io/releases/download/MPLabX_Code/Subsystem_GC_MPLabX.zip" download>here</a>
