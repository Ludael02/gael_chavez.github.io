## Introduction

* This individual datasheet was designed as one of four parts that will make up the final product in this EGR304 course. This GitHub contains most of the entire development process for this individual component.

### Project Summary

This project aims to assist in the separation and organization of trash in homes and selected locations. This individual design helps this project by processing the weight of the trash and transforming that value into a visual representation for the user.
