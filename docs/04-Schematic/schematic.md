## Overview

This schematic shows the complete circuit design for the light sensor subsystem. Figure 01 shows the nine sections that make up the light sensor subsystem. These are: the Curiosity Nano in the center, the light sensor in the horizontal rectangle in the upper left corner, the voltage regulator in the upper rectangle, the power supply for the Curiosity Nano in the rectangle to its right, the LED scale on the far right, the debugging push button in the lower right corner, the test LED to the left of the debugging button, and the ribbon cables below the Curiosity Nano.
