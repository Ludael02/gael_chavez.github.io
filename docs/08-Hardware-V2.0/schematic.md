## Reflection

The main objective of this project within this class was always to design a product using multiple sensors and other types of outputs learned in class. For this, our chosen idea was a trash can with motion and force sensors, along with a motor and speaker. The product was designed and functioned cohesively. Now that the product is finished and I have a better understanding of the tools, software, and operation of certain components, there are several things I would like to change or would change for a new revision of this subsystem. Starting with the sensor, initially, a force sensor was selected for this subsystem. Over time, it was decided to change to a photoresistor. This happened due to a malfunction of the sensor we acquired and because of the short time available between that moment and the delivery. I would dedicate more time to researching materials and components for this project. I would investigate more options that fit the needs.

Another important area that wasn't a problem in my case but could have been was the placement of the header pins. I added six header pins as a backup plan in case any port failed and needed replacing. After finishing the schematic and manufacturing the PCB, I realized that not all microcontroller pins can function as analog pins for a DAC or ADC. Therefore, I only had a single pin to receive analog information from the sensor. I would change the header pin connections after researching which pins are suitable for these specific signals.

Another issue to review is the quality and type of the selected components. If I had to revise this project, I would completely discard the buttons used for the debug button and the voltage regulator, as they are not only quite fragile but also awkward to use. I would replace the debug button with a slightly larger one that has better connections and greater durability. I would also completely replace the voltage regulator button with a switch.
