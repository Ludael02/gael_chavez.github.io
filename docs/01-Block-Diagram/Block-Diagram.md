## Overview

This block diagram shows the first solid construction of the light sensor subsystem circuit. The diagram illustrates the microcontroller's connections to the sensor, the multiple outputs, and the communication between controllers and other team members via ribbon cables. The other components of the diagram are also visible. Although the system initially supplies 9 volts, this voltage passes through a regulator that distributes 5 functional volts to the system located within the dotted line. Arrows between connections indicate the flow of information and specify whether the signal is digital or analog, as well as the type of controller required for the inputs and outputs.
