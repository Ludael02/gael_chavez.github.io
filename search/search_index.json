The diagram illustrates the microcontroller's connections to the sensor, the multiple outputs, and the communication between controllers and other team members via ribbon cables. The other components in the diagram are also visible. Although the system initially supplies 9 volts, this voltage passes through a regulator that distributes 5 functional volts to the system located within the dotted line. Arrows between connections indicate the flow of information and specify whether the signal is digital or analog, as well as the type of controller required for the inputs and outputs. The light sensor communicates with the op-amp, amplifying and inverting the received signal to meet the sensor's requirements before it is read by the microcontroller.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#individual-block-diagram","title":"Individual Block Diagram","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection Example","text":"<p>Table 1: Force sensor</p> <p>Internal Weight limit module</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1.

This option has the best price of the three, as one can only be purchased in packs of 8, and the other is quite expensive due to its precision and size. Second, the pin selection is exposed and easily accessible for soldering. In turn, its light weight and design are quite helpful for the model we want to produce, where the basket rests on the base of the sensor.</p> <p>Table 2: Op Amp</p> <p>Internal Weight limit module</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1.
