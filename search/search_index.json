The diagram illustrates the microcontroller's connections to the sensor, the multiple outputs, and the communication between controllers and other team members via ribbon cables. The other components in the diagram are also visible. Although the system initially supplies 9 volts, this voltage passes through a regulator that distributes 5 functional volts to the system located within the dotted line. Arrows between connections indicate the flow of information and specify whether the signal is digital or analog, as well as the type of controller required for the inputs and outputs. The light sensor communicates with the op-amp, amplifying and inverting the received signal to meet the sensor's requirements before it is read by the microcontroller.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#individual-block-diagram","title":"Individual Block Diagram","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection","text":""},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#table-1-force-sensor","title":"Table 1: Force sensor","text":"Solution Pros Cons Option 1.

This option has the best price of the three, as one can only be purchased in packs of 8, and the other is quite expensive due to its precision and size. Second, the pin selection is exposed and easily accessible for soldering. In turn, its light weight and design are quite helpful for the model we want to produce, where the basket rests on the base of the sensor.</p>"},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#table-2-op-amp","title":"Table 2: Op Amp","text":"Solution Pros Cons Option 1.

For this, our chosen idea was a trash can with motion and force sensors, along with a motor and speaker. The product was designed and functioned cohesively. Now that the product is finished and I have a better understanding of the tools, software, and operation of certain components, there are several things I would like to change or would change for a new revision of this subsystem. Starting with the sensor, initially, a force sensor was selected for this subsystem. Over time, it was decided to change to a photoresistor. This happened due to a malfunction of the sensor we acquired and because of the short time available between that moment and the delivery. I would dedicate more time to researching materials and components for this project. I would investigate more options that fit the needs.</p> <p>Another important area that wasn't a problem in my case but could have been was the placement of the header pins. I added six header pins as a backup plan in case any port failed and needed replacing. After finishing the schematic and manufacturing the PCB, I realized that not all microcontroller pins can function as analog pins for a DAC or ADC. Therefore, I only had a single pin to receive analog information from the sensor. I would change the header pin connections after researching which pins are suitable for these specific signals.</p> <p>Another issue to review is the quality and type of the selected components. If I had to revise this project, I would completely discard the buttons used for the debug button and the voltage regulator, as they are not only quite fragile but also awkward to use. I would replace the debug button with a slightly larger one that has better connections and greater durability. I would also completely replace the voltage regulator button with a switch.</p>"}]}
