This option has the best price of the three, as one can only be purchased in packs of 8, and the other is quite expensive due to its precision and size. Second, the pin selection is exposed and easily accessible for soldering. In turn, its light weight and design are quite helpful for the model we want to produce, where the basket rests on the base of the sensor.</p> <p>Table 2: Op Amp</p> <p>Internal Weight limit module</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1.
