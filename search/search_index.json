Capacitive Force Sensor 8 mm 100 N (22 lbs)$37.50/eachlink to product *Inexpensive* Fall within the weight limits* Connections are easy access * Requieres model specific addons* Brittle. * Option 2. * FSG005WNPB * $129.62/each * Link to product * Small in size * Low error percantage  * Easy pin acces * More expensive * Small sensor base * Option 3. * FlexiForce A201 Sensor * $153.16/8pack * Link to product * Good weight tolerance * Great Temperature tolerance range  * Lightweight * Only available in 8packs * Hard pin access <p>Choice: Option 1: Capacitive Force Sensor 8 mm 100 N (22 lbs)</p> <p>Rationale: Our choice 1 (Capacitive Force Sensor) is the option chosen for three different reasons: price, style, and versatility. This option has the best price of the three, as one can only be purchased in packs of 8, and the other is quite expensive due to its precision and size. Second, the pin selection is exposed and easily accessible for soldering. In turn, its light weight and design are quite helpful for the model we want to produce, where the basket rests on the base of the sensor.</p> <p>Table 2: Op Amp</p> <p>Internal Weight limit module</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1.
